## 💡 Final Tips for Students

### Using This Document

1. **Complete BEFORE coding:** This document helps you think through your project systematically
2. **Be realistic:** Don't over-scope! It's better to deliver a polished MVP than an incomplete ambitious project
3. **Reference often:** Keep coming back to this document throughout development
4. **Update as needed:** If requirements change, update this document immediately
5. **Share with stakeholders:** Make sure everyone understands the scope

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Scope Creep:** Adding features during development that weren't planned
❌ **Vague Requirements:** "Make it fast" vs. "Lighthouse Performance ≥ 85"
❌ **Ignoring Constraints:** Planning features that require resources you don't have
❌ **No Prioritization:** Treating all features as equally important
❌ **Skipping Testing:** Planning to "add tests later" (they rarely get added)

### Success Factors

✅ **Clear Priorities:** Know your must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
✅ **Realistic Timeline:** Build in buffer time for unexpected issues
✅ **User Focus:** Keep asking "Does this serve my users?"
✅ **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to have 3 polished features than 10 half-done ones
✅ **Continuous Testing:** Test early and often, not just at the end

**Remember:** This document is a living guide. Update it as you learn more about your project!

**Good luck building something awesome!**
